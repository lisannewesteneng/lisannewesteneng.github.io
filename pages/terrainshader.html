        <h2>Terrain Wave Shader</h2>
        <p>I wanted to learn how to code shaders in Unity, so I watched "Intro to Shader Coding in Unity - An Improvised Live Course", a 5 hour long YouTube video by Freya Holmer. Then I gave myself the assignment to create my own shader with the new knowledge I got from the video.</p>
        <p>At the end of the video, Freya showed how to make a wave-like shader around a simple shoreline (heightmap). I decided to use this wave shader as a starting point and improve on it. I wanted the waves to appear only around the mountains, and not on top of it, and I wanted the movement of the waves to be more realistic.</p>

        <p>It took me some time to figure out how to get rid of the waves on the mountains itself. To start, I multiplied the waveAmplitude with 1-terrainHeight, which doesn’t completely eliminate the waves, but it makes them a lot smaller based on the height of the terrain. After trying a lot of things, I found out that I could use the step function to eliminate waveAmplitudes below a certain value, which means it removed the smaller waves on the mountains.</p>
        <p>I wanted the wave motion to go back and forth instead of only in one direction. To achieve this I put the Time variable inside a sine function. To make the time sine wave more ‘unpredictable’, I added two sin(time) waves with different periods together, to create a wave that doesn’t repeat itself that often. The next problem was that the waves would now all move at the same time. To solve this, I needed to add an offset to the wave that is different for each fragment, so I used the distance between the fragment position and (0,0,0) as an offset. This way the waves would all move back and forth at a slightly different time, which made them look a bit more realistic.</p>
        <p>This resulted in the shader shown in the video below, or view the code on <a href="https://github.com/lisannewesteneng/TerrainWaveShader" target="_blank">github</a>.</p>
