        <h2>To the past</h2>
        <p>'To the past' is a mobile app about history, that I made together with 5 other students for a project.</p>

            <h4>Project Startup</h4>
            <p>The app 'To the past' is the result of project Startup, a project in the second year of Creative Media &amp; Game Technologies. The goal was to create an interactive digital product that is marketable and profitable. The project took 3 weeks, so we only made a vertical slice. 'To the past' is a GPS-based app, that shows the user the history of interesting places around them. To really make the history visible, we used augmented reality to show users 3D models of old objects or buildings in their current environment.</p>
            <p>For me this was the first time making  a mobile app, and making something that uses augmented reality. I spent a lot of time on the map, which teached me a lot about using a map API and touchscreen input.</p>
